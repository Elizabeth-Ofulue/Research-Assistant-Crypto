    "Write a 500-word explanation of Bitcoin stock-to-flow model and make an argument for why it is a bad model? "

    "> ### Solution\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Bitcoin is the first digital object that cannot be copied, duplicated, pirated or forged. It is the first digitally scarce thing known to mankind and is relatively costly to produce, with a maximum supply estimated at about 21 million coins. These primary attributes give Bitcoin its unique value.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The Stock to Flow model is a means of measuring the abundance of a particular resource. It measures the relationship between the currently available stock of a resource and its production rate. It is typically applied to precious metals and natural resources e.g. Gold\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The Bitcoin Stock to Flow model relies on the assumption that scarcity, as measured by the model, should drive value. Although every model is as strong as its assumptions, this assumption may not be able to account for all aspects of Bitcoin valuation thereby making the model vulnerable and flawed. In this case, the Bitcoin stock to flow model is deemed flawed and a bad model due to the following:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Bitcoin doesn’t have any other useful qualities other than supply scarcity: with Gold having scarcity, predictable flow, and global liquidity, it is a relatively stable store of value. The same cannot be said of Bitcoin as it is likely to be prone to devaluation despite its scarcity if other qualities are absent.\n",
    "> * Bitcoin’s volatility spikes over time: the valuation of an asset requires taking into account its volatility and according to the stock to flow model, Bitcoin’s volatility should also decrease over time. This is confirmed by historical data from Coinmetrics.. If the volatility is predictable to some extent, the valuation model may be more reliable. However, Bitcoin is notorious for its large price changes.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> While the volatility may be decreasing on the macro level, Bitcoin will have been priced in a free market from its inception. This means that the price is mostly self-regulated on the open market by users, traders, and speculators. Combining this factor with the relatively low liquidity, Bitcoin is seen to be most likely exposed to sudden spikes of volatility than other assets. The stock to flow model may not be able to account for this either.\n",
    "> * Another factor to be considered that could also undermine this model, is the economic Black Swan events. A Black Swan event, is an event with an element of surprise which has a significant effect. It should be noted that historical data cannot account for unknown event and this factor applies to the stock to flow model or any other model that tries to predict the price of an asset based on historical data.\n",
    "> * Data Accuracy: it should be noted that at this time Bitcoin has only existed for a little over 10 years. Although Bitcoin has already been the best performing investment in the 2010s, it will need to be the best performing asset in every single decade in this century for the stock-to-flow model to continue working. Therefore, there is need for a larger data set for more reliable accuracy with the use of long-term valuation models like the Stock to Flow."
